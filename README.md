Introduction

In the competitive landscape of financial services, understanding customer behavior, transaction patterns, and channel utilization is crucial for enhancing operational efficiency and strategic planning. BILMIDAL PLC, a financial institution, commissioned a comprehensive transaction analysis for the fiscal year 2023. This report leverages dashboard visualizations to extract actionable insights for performance optimization and customer engagement.

Purpose of the Project

The primary purpose of this project is to evaluate and monitor the transaction trends, customer segmentation, channel performance, and location-based usage within BILMIDAL PLC for the year 2023. This analysis will support decision-makers in identifying growth opportunities, resolving performance gaps, and guiding marketing and service delivery strategies.

Objectives

The main objectives of the financial transaction analysis project are as follows:

To monitor the monthly transaction volumes and account balances.
To determine the most utilized transaction types and channels.
To identify top-performing customer categories and age demographics.
To evaluate transaction distribution across different geographic locations.
To develop targeted recommendations for improving service offerings and operational efficiency.
Problem Being Addressed

Despite a growing customer base, BILMIDAL PLC faces several operational and strategic challenges:

A noticeable dip in transaction activity in April 2023, indicating possible service disruption or customer disengagement.
Underutilization of digital and credit-based transaction channels.
Skewed customer engagement towards specific age groups and regions, with reduced activity among older demographics and in certain locations.
Inefficiencies in promoting high-value locations and transaction channels.
This analysis aims to uncover the root causes of these challenges and propose solutions to address them effectively.

OBSERVATIONS

1. ATM Dominance: ATM remains the most preferred channel, accounting for the highest transaction volume.

2. High Youth Engagement: Customers aged 10–29 and 50–69 are the most active, with students being the top customer segment.

3. Credit Transactions Lag: Credit usage is significantly lower than debit transactions.

4. Geographic Clustering: Transaction activities are concentrated in top-tier cities like Fort Worth and Los Angeles.

5. Seasonal Dip in April: April experienced the lowest transaction volume, indicating either operational or external seasonal influences.

6. Digital Adoption on the Rise: Online channel usage is catching up to traditional branch transactions.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Address April Performance Dip: Investigate causes of the sharp decline and introduce stability measures for Q2.

2. Capitalize on Student Segment: Develop student-focused products and campaigns, including digital wallets and campus-based engagement.

3. Expand Credit Offerings: Educate customers on the benefits of credit and introduce more accessible credit solutions.

4. Promote Digital Banking Channels: Incentivize online usage to reduce branch load and enhance customer convenience.

5. Target Active Age Groups (10–69): Create segmented marketing strategies focusing on their specific financial behaviors.

6. Invest in Top-Performing Locations: Allocate more resources and marketing to high-performing cities for better ROI.

7. Support Financial Inclusion for Seniors (70–89): Simplify onboarding and usage processes to improve accessibility for the elderly population.

CONCLUSIONS

This financial transaction analysis for BILMIDAL PLC (2023) reveals strong youth engagement, ATM channel dependence, and opportunities to boost credit service uptake. The data highlights areas of operational efficiency as well as underperforming segments that can be optimized with strategic focus. Data-driven improvements will lead to greater customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and revenue growth.
